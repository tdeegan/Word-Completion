# Word-Completion

word-completion.py creates a dictionary from a series of news articles containing in excess of 80,000 words ('ap_docs.txt').

It then solicits the user for a prefix and provides a list of all possible word completions for the given prefix.

If there are no possible word completions for the prefix in the created dictionary, the message "No Completions" is displayed.

The program terminates when the user presses Ctrl+D on macOS/Linux or Ctrl+Z on Windows.
